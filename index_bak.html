                                <h2 class="section-title">Welcome to NSMIS portal training</h2>
                                <p>The National Sanitation Management Information System (NSMIS) for Tanzania was developed to address the historical challenge of collection and storage of household and institutional WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) data. The Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children (MoHCDGEC) in collaboration with partners made a stance decision to ensure data for WASH is stored and made accessible at all times and help in making informed decisions in the sector. The NSMIS is developed on the dhis.2 (District Health Information System 2) software and can run on all Operating Systems including Windows, Linux, Mac OSX and Solaris. It is also compatible with all major web browsers and can run on all computers.</p>
                                <div id="NSMIS_background"  class="section-block">
                                    <h3 class="block-title">NSMIS background</h3>
                                    <p>Although the NSMIS is under the MoHCDGEC it is intended to be used by anyone interested in data on WASH in the country. The system pulls data from the primary collection level (the sub-villages) and aggregate at different levels i.e. village, ward, council, region and national. The use of NSMIS started in 2014-5 being piloted in selected regions namely; Njombe, Mbeya, Iringa, Dodoma, Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro, Kigoma, Rukwa and Ruvuma. Afterwards rolled out across the country, In July, 2017 the Ministry ordered all the councils and regions to report the progress on implementation of the National Sanitation Campaign (NSC) through NSMIS. Since then, all the progress reports are delivered from the system making it easier to report and also track the trend systematically.</p>
                                    
                                </div><!--//section-block-->

                                    <h3 class="block-title">Key features and purpose of the NSMIS</h3>
                                    <p>The NSMIS has been instrumental in facilitating timely reporting and sharing of data to stakeholders whenever they are needed. This makes possible to routinely track the progress of the Sustainable Development Goal number 6.2 (SDG 6.2) on the elimination of Open Defecation and accelerating the national efforts of increasing access to safely managed sanitation, as well as basic hygiene facilities at households’ level, institutions and public places.</p>
                                    <p>The introduction of web portal has ended the era of using credentials to enable someone to access the information. It is our sincere hope that, partners and the public in general will find the NSMIS and its web portal very helpful for decision making, planning, implementation and monitoring of sanitation and hygiene in the country.</p>
                                    <p>The system is live and would be updated from time to time based on the upgrades in the software, users need and policy changes over time.</p>

                                <h2 class="section-title">Technical background</h2>
                                <p>DHIS 2 can be perceived as a platform on several levels. First, the application database is designed ground-up with flexibility in mind. Data structures such as data elements, organisation units, forms and user roles can be defined completely freely through the application user interface. This makes it possible for the system to be adapted to a multitude of locale contexts and use-cases. We have seen that DHIS 2 supports most major requirements for routine data capture and analysis emerging in country implementations. It also makes it possible for DHIS 2 to serve as management system for domains such as logistics, labs and finance.</p>
                                <p>Second, due to the modular design of DHIS 2 it can be extended with additional software modules or through custom apps. These software modules/apps can live side by side with the core modules of DHIS 2 and can be integrated into the DHIS 2 portal and menu system. This is a powerful feature as it makes it possible to extend the system with extra functionality when needed, typically for country specific requirements as earlier pointed out.</p>
                                <p>The downside of the software module extensibility is that it puts several constraints on the development process. The developers creating the extra functionality are limited to the DHIS 2 technology in terms of programming language and software frameworks, in addition to the constraints put on the design of modules by the DHIS 2 portal solution. Also, these modules must be included in the DHIS 2 software when the software is built and deployed on the web server, not dynamically during run-time In order to overcome these limitations and achieve a looser coupling between the DHIS service layer and additional software artifacts, a REST-based API has been developed as part of DHIS 2.</p>
                                <p>This Web API complies with the rules of the REST architectural style. This implies that:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The Web API provides a navigable and machine-readable interface to the complete DHIS 2 data model. For instance, one can access the full list of data elements, then navigate using the provided URL to a particular data element of interest, then navigate using the provided URL to the list of data sets which the data element is a member of.</li>
                                    <li>(Meta) Data is accessed through a uniform interface (URLs) using plain HTTP requests. There are no fancy transport formats or protocols involved - just the well-tested, well-understood HTTP protocol which is the main building block of the Web today. This implies that third-party developers can develop software using the DHIS 2 data model and data without knowing the DHIS 2specific technology or complying with the DHIS 2 design constraints.</li>
                                    <li>All data including meta-data, reports, maps and charts, known as resources in REST terminology, can be retrieved in most of the popular representation formats of the Web of today, such as XML, JSON, PDF and PNG. These formats are widely supported in applications and programming languages and gives third-party developers a wide range of implementation options.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <p>The NSMIS portal contains 23 indicators that can be quickly located in the report’s menu, not all of them allow visualizing data, this is because there is no data available to be able to be visualized, to the extent that the MoH works in the collection of information, the reports of the missing indicators can be visualized.</p>
